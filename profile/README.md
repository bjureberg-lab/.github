# Bjureberg lab

This is home to code hosted and shared by members of Johan Bjureberg's research group at [Karolinska Institutet](https://ki.se/en/cns/johan-bjureberg-and-clara-hellners-research-group). The main purpose is collaboration within the group in private repositories, but we will likely have some public repositories as well.

Are you a member of the lab and want access? Contact Oskar Flygare (@oskarflygare / oskar.flygare [at] ki.se) to receive an invite!
